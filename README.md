In this project, you will see :

How you can use data visualization techniques to answer to some analytical questions regarding the pandemic 2020.

We are going to use COVID19 dataset for the year 2020 consisting of the data related cumulative number of confirmed, 
recovered, and deaths cases.

We are going to prepare this dataset to answer these questions: 

 How does the Global Spread of the virus look like?
- Confirmed
- Recovered

 How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries? 

We are going to use Plotly module, which is a great visualization tool in python, in order to plot some 
insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.

We are also going to use Dash a feature of plotly to run it on a local server. 

You can download the requirements with

	`pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
  `pip install plotly_express==0.4.1`
